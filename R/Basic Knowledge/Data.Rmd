# Data
Data are values of quantitative or qualitative variables, belong to a set of items.
So the set of items might be the population or the set of objects that you might be interested in.
## Raw Data
- Original source of data
- Hard to straight-forwardly use for data analyses
- Include the processing 
- May need to be processed once or several times.
- String, binary, unformatted Excel, JSON from Twitter API.

- Haven't been run through any programme
## Processed data
- Data ready for analysis
- Extracting, subsetting, transforming
- All step should be recorded -> Understanding the pipeline

## Tidy data
- Code book desc each variables and its values in the tidy data set
- Explicit and exact recipe you use to go from raw to tidy
- Each variable you measure should be in one column
- Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
- There should be one table for each kind of variable
- If having multiple tables, should have a column in the data where it could be linked.

*Tips*:
- Including a row on top as header name
- Make variable name human readable
- One file per table

## Code book
- Including units (information about the variables)
- Summary choices you made
- Experimental study design you used

*Tips*:
- Common format is a text file
- Should have a section called "Study design" that has a thorough desc of how you collected the data
- Section called "Code book" having desc and its units


## Instruction list
- A computer script
- Input should be raw data
- Output the processed, tidy data
- No params is needed to Include

In case of not possible processing all the data by scripts:
- Should provide instructions
- Giving all the parameter including, which version
- The more explicit the better it is


# Collecting data
- Remember to set your working directory.
- Windown use backlash while programming languages usually use forthlash

## Checking for and creating directory
- file.exist("dirName")
- dir.create("dirName")

## Download file
- download.file(params)
- Important params: url, destfile, method
- Useful for downloading tab-delimited, csv, text file
- https can used method curl (default method of Window)
- Remember to keep track of the date
- If the file is big, it will take a while
- Should record when you downloaded to check the version of the file

## Reading local file
- read.table(), read.csv(), read.csv2()
- read.table() can be slow, require more data than other function
- na.strings() to set the character that represents a missing value
- skip to indicate the number of lines to skip before starting to read
- When having trouble with flat files which are having qoutation marks ` or " placed in data values,
setting qoute="" often resolves these.

### Reading excel files
- Load the library(xlxs)
- use read.xlsx()
- Remember to call the sheetIndex
- Can read specific rows and columns

#### Notes:
- write.xlxs() for writing
- read.xlxs2() unstable but faster
- XLConnect has more options for writing and manipulating Excel files
- XLConnect vignette to start

### Rading XML
- Extensible markup language
- Used to stored structured data
- Widely used in internet applications
- Basis of web scraping

#### Tags, Elements and Attributes
- Start and closed tag like HTML
- Empty tag like img tag <img/>

- Elements like components, tag but another name
- Having attributes just like HTML alt, src

- library(XML)
- xmlTreeParse() function for reading structure XML files
- xmlRoot() access the document
- xmlName() to get name 

- Can be directly access parts of XML document
- rootNode[[1]] -> first sub component

- Can go through by xmlSApply(rootNode, xmlValues)
- Go through and
