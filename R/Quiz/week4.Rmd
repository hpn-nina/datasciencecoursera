1. What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?
```{r}
set.seed(1)
rpois(5,2)
-> [1] 1 1 2 4 1
```

2. What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?
-> rnorm

3. When simulating data, why is using the set.seed() function important? Select all that apply.
-> It can be used to specify which random number generating algorithm R should use, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

4. Which function can be used to evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution function for the Poisson distribution?
-> qpois

5. What does the following code do?
```{r}
set.seed(10)
x <- rep(0:1, each = 5)
e <- rnorm(10, 0, 20)
y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e
```
-> Generate data from a Normal linear model

6. What R function can be used to generate Binomial random variables?
-> rbinorm

7. What aspect of the R runtime does the profiler keep track of when an R expression is evaluated?
-> the function call stack

8. Consider the following R code
```{r}
library(datasets)
Rprof()
fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
Rprof(NULL)
```

-> 100%

9. When using 'system.time()', what is the user time?
-> It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression

10. If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take advantage of that, then which of the following is true when using 'system.time()'?
-> elapsed time may be smaller than user time
